- Use `bun` as the package manager for workspace creation, package installation, monorepo, commands etc., refer to docs [bun-docs.md](mdc:ai-ref/external-docs/bun-docs.md)
- Use `Drizzle` lib for ORM and DB migration with postgres DB [drizzle-docs.md](mdc:ai-ref/external-docs/drizzle-docs.md)
- Use `Clerk` for auth, refer to docs [clerk-docs.md](mdc:ai-ref/external-docs/clerk-docs.md)

# Dev Process
- When using any framework/lib, first check if its installed
- Use `Playwright` MCP for using browser to validate changes that affect UI and integration with backend
- Use `Postgres` MCP server to check schemas and validate migration
- Always use [project-spec.md](mdc:ai-ref/project-docs/project-spec.md) to understand the overall project requirements 
- Always use [project-plan.md](mdc:ai-ref/project-docs/project-plan.md) as JIRA to create, update and track implementation of various functionalities 
- Feel free to ask follow up clarifying questions for better understanding if something in the user request, plan, spec is unclear, vague or ambigious 
- Do not re-run the dev server as hot-reloading is active

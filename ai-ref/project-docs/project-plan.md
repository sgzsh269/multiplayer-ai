#### Legend: [ ] Not Started | [~] In Progress | [x] Completed

### 1. Project Setup & Scaffolding ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] **1.1** Scaffold a Next.js (App Router) project in the `packages` directory using Bun.
- [x] **1.2** Set up monorepo structure with Bun workspaces.
- [x] **1.3** Initialize a shared internal library package for common types and utilities.

---

### 2. Install and Configure Core Libraries ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] **2.1** Install and configure the following libraries in the appropriate packages:
  - Next.js
  - Drizzle ORM (with Postgres driver)
  - Clerk (authentication)
  - Zustand (frontend state management)
  - Zod (schema validation)
  - AI SDK (for chat assistant)
  - Shadcn UI (UI components)
  - Playwright (for E2E testing)
  - TypeScript (if not already present)
- [x] **2.2** Set up basic TypeScript config and linting for all packages.

---

### 3. Database & Auth Foundation ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] **3.1** Set up Drizzle ORM with Postgres connection in the backend.
